# Customer Churn Prediction: A Comprehensive Machine Learning Approach

## 1. Introduction

Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers discontinue their relationship with a company, is a critical business challenge, especially in the telecom industry. This document provides a detailed explanation of the ensemble machine learning approach implemented to predict customer churn for a telecom company, combining deep learning and gradient boosting techniques.

## 2. Problem Definition

**Business Problem**: Identify customers who are likely to churn (cancel their service) so that the company can take proactive measures to retain them.

**Machine Learning Task**: Binary classification to predict whether a customer will churn ('yes') or not ('no').

**Success Metrics**:
- High recall for the 'yes' class (minimize false negatives)
- Good overall accuracy and AUC
- Interpretable results to inform business decisions

## 3. Data Understanding

### 3.1 Dataset Overview

The Telco Customer Churn dataset contains information about:
- Customer demographics (gender, age, partners, dependents)
- Account information (tenure, contract, payment method)
- Services signed up for (phone, internet, tech support, streaming)
- Billing information (monthly charges, total charges)

### 3.2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Key insights from EDA:

1. **Class Imbalance**: Approximately 26% of customers churned, indicating class imbalance.

2. **Contract Type**: Month-to-month contracts have significantly higher churn rates (~43%) compared to one-year (~11%) or two-year contracts (~3%).

3. **Tenure**: Customers with shorter tenure are more likely to churn. The median tenure for churned customers is significantly lower than for non-churned customers.

4. **Internet Service**: Fiber optic customers have higher churn rates than DSL customers.

5. **Payment Method**: Customers using electronic checks have higher churn rates.

6. **Additional Services**: Customers without online security, tech support, or backup services are more likely to churn.

7. **Monthly Charges**: Higher monthly charges correlate with increased churn probability.

## 4. Data Preparation

### 4.1 Data Cleaning

1. **Missing Values**: Identified and imputed missing values in the TotalCharges column using the median.

2. **Categorical Variables**: Converted all categorical variables to lowercase for consistency.

3. **Data Type Conversion**: Ensured proper data types for all columns, particularly converting TotalCharges to float.

4. **Outlier Detection**: Identified outliers using IQR method but kept them as they represent valid business scenarios.

### 4.2 Feature Engineering

1. **Categorical Encoding**: Applied one-hot encoding to categorical variables, dropping the first category to avoid multicollinearity.

2. **Numerical Scaling**: Standardized numerical features to have zero mean and unit variance.

3. **Feature Selection**: Kept all features as initial analysis showed most variables had predictive power.

### 4.3 Data Splitting

Split the data into:
- Training set (64%): Used for model training
- Validation set (16%): Used for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping
- Test set (20%): Used for final evaluation

Stratified sampling was used to maintain the same class distribution across all splits.

## 5. Model Development

### 5.1 Neural Network Model

The neural network architecture consists of:

1. **Input Layer**: Matches the dimensionality of processed features

2. **Hidden Layers**:
   - First hidden layer: 128 neurons with ReLU activation
   - Second hidden layer: 64 neurons with ReLU activation
   - Third hidden layer: 32 neurons with ReLU activation

3. **Regularization Techniques**:
   - Batch normalization after each hidden layer
   - Dropout (30% after first layer, 20% after second layer)
   - L2 regularization (weight decay) with factor 0.001

4. **Output Layer**: Single neuron with sigmoid activation

### 5.2 Gradient Boosting Model
